<!-- add Chatbot Response bellow-->
Yes, there are several command-line tools available to convert a JSON file into a JSON Schema. These tools typically work by analyzing the structure and data types within one or more sample JSON documents and then inferring a schema that would validate them.

### Popular Command-Line Tools

There are a few key options you can consider, depending on your environment and needs.

* **`json-schema-generator` (NPM Package)**: This is a popular tool for Node.js environments. It's easy to install via npm and provides a straightforward command-line interface. You can pipe a JSON file to it or specify an input file directly. The tool analyzes the JSON and outputs a draft of a schema. 

* **`quicktype`**: While `quicktype` is best known for generating code from JSON, it also has a feature to generate JSON Schema. It's a versatile tool that can be used on the command line to infer a schema from a JSON file or a directory of sample files.

* **`json-cli` (Python/Docker)**: This is a robust, multi-functional tool with a range of features beyond just schema generation, including validation, formatting, and diffing. You can use it to build a schema from a JSON instance, and it can be run directly from a Docker container, making it easy to use in various environments without a complex setup.
