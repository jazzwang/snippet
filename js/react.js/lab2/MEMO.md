#### could you analyze js/react.js/lab2/src/index.tsx and give me the steps to run this react program?

To run the React program in `js/react.js/lab2/src/index.tsx`, you will need to follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Set Up the Project**:
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.
   - Run the following command to create a new React app (if you haven't already):
     ```
     npx create-react-app lab2
     ```
   - Navigate into the project directory:
     ```
     cd lab2
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Since the code uses `next-auth`, you will need to install it along with React and ReactDOM. Run the following command:
     ```
     npm install next-auth react react-dom
     ```

4. **Replace the Default Code**:
   - Navigate to the `src` folder of your project and replace the contents of `index.tsx` with the provided code.

5. **Run the Application**:
   - In the terminal, run the following command to start the development server:
     ```
     npm start
     ```
   - This will start the application, and you can view it in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

6. **Sign In Configuration**:
   - Make sure to configure the authentication providers (Google and GitHub) in your NextAuth configuration if you plan to use the sign-in functionality.

- 結果：看到空白的頁面。
- 追蹤：
  - 比較 `lab1/src/index.tsx` 跟 `lab2/src/index.tsx` 差異最大的是 `lab1` 會用 `App.tsx`
