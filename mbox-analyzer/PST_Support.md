If you need to deal with Office 365 or Outlook, the file format is PST(Personal Storage Table).

* [Export or backup email, contacts, and calendar to an Outlook .pst file](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/export-or-backup-email-contacts-and-calendar-to-an-outlook-pst-file-14252b52-3075-4e9b-be4e-ff9ef1068f91)
