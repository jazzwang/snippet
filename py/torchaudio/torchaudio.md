<table><tr><td>Q:</td><td>
<!-- add your Prompt bellow-->
could you give me a python example to read a AAC audio file and output the transcript? use any popular huggingface model would be great.

<!-- add Chatbot Response bellow-->
To transcribe an AAC audio file using a Hugging Face model in Python, you can use the **Whisper** model from OpenAI, which is available via the `transformers` and `torchaudio` libraries. Here's a complete example:

### ‚úÖ Requirements
Make sure you have the following installed:

```bash
pip install transformers torchaudio librosa
```

### üìÑ Python Example

```python
import torchaudio
from transformers import pipeline

# Load the audio file (AAC format)
audio_path = "your_audio_file.aac"
waveform, sample_rate = torchaudio.load(audio_path)

# Whisper expects 16kHz audio
if sample_rate != 16000:
    resampler = torchaudio.transforms.Resample(orig_freq=sample_rate, new_freq=16000)
    waveform = resampler(waveform)

# Use Hugging Face's Whisper model pipeline
transcriber = pipeline("automatic-speech-recognition", model="openai/whisper-base")

# Transcribe the audio
transcription = transcriber(waveform.squeeze().numpy(), sampling_rate=16000)

print("Transcript:")
print(transcription["text"])
```

### üîç Notes
- You can replace `"openai/whisper-base"` with `"openai/whisper-large"` for better accuracy (but it‚Äôs slower and more resource-intensive).
- Whisper models support multiple languages. If your AAC file is in Mandarin or another language, you can specify `language="zh"` or similar in the pipeline config.

Would you like me to adapt this for a specific language or help you run it on a sample file?
