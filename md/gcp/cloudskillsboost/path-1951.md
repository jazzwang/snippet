EUGÉNIE RIVES: So when leader and team member are not leveraging gen AI, we see different risk coming with it. One of the risk is slowing down productivity. They are providing a new way of seeing things. And that could be, actually, a challenge, not using them, because then you miss out of new way of doing things and new opportunity for your organization. My name is Eugénie Rives. And I'm currently managing director for gen AI strategy in DeepMind. So Google DeepMind is a unit within Google that is deploying AI responsibly to benefit humanity. I think our latest gen-AI model can help organization to be more productive, to work faster, and, as well, to create new use case, things that we were not able to do before. One of them is document summarization. Another example, and it's about translation-- but I'm not a native English speaker. So I always use Gemini to actually translate my email or use specific American way of phrasing things. I'm very excited about Gemini because it's our most powerful model yet. Now you are able to prompt into the model and ask the model to create a video for you. Another example that was not possible before-- it's to ingest documents. And then it creates a podcast between two speaker that are talking about the topic you are interested in. And now, again, you can do it within minutes. So one of the most impressive application I'm seeing currently is coding. Now anyone in your company is able to use those models to code and to produce new outcome in a very rapid manner and really turbocharge your productivity. The survey we run in the UK that workers can save 122 hours per year using gen AI tools-- so that's a massive impact on productivity. We now have very advanced models that are able to think and reason. The more you can ingest really quality data into the model across different modality-- across text, video, images-- it's going to make the model just perform better for your organization. The world is going very fast right now using those tools. It's important to stay ahead of the competition, to be able to innovate faster, and to have teams that are much more productive and efficient. Organization needs to evolve and use them in order to stay ahead of the market. Leadership can help in many ways, but the most obvious ways is around education. So it's very important for people to take the time to educate oneself with a gen-AI leader training. It's a way to invest in yourself. It's a way to invest in your organization. It's a way to understand the capability, and also limitation, of those models so you can use them the best possible way. [MUSIC PLAYING]
