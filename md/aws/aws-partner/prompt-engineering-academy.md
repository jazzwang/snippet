| Prompt Engineering Academy Session 1 | This content provides model-agnostic guidelines on prompt engineering for generative AI workloads. In this session discover the value of prompt engineering and basic prompt engineering techniques for foundation models. ([Video](https://partnercentral.awspartner.com/partnercentral2/s/resources?Id=a1G8W00000F9j1DUAR)) and ([Slides](https://partnercentral.awspartner.com/partnercentral2/s/resources?Id=0698W0000105OVpQAM)) | https://vimeo.com/1004241642 |
| Prompt Engineering Academy Session 2 | This content provides model-agnostic guidelines on prompt engineering for generative AI workloads. In this session discover advanced prompt engineering techniques and Amazon Bedrock features to orchestrate prompt lifecycles and generative AI workflows at scale. ([Video](https://partnercentral.awspartner.com/partnercentral2/s/resources?Id=a1G8W00000F9j1IUAR)) and ([Slides](https://partnercentral.awspartner.com/partnercentral2/s/resources?Id=0698W0000105OWTQA2)) | https://vimeo.com/1004242828 |
| Prompt Engineering Academy Session 3 | This content provides model-agnostic guidelines on prompt engineering for generative AI workloads. In this session discover guidelines to secure generative AI workloads, including securing prompts from vulnerabilities using Guardrails for Amazon Bedrock. ([Video](https://partnercentral.awspartner.com/partnercentral2/s/resources?Id=a1G8W00000F9j5fUAB)) and ([Slides](https://partnercentral.awspartner.com/partnercentral2/s/resources?Id=0698W0000105pw9QAA)) | https://vimeo.com/1013688350 |
| Prompt Engineering Academy Session 4 | In this session, you will learn about a popular generative AI technique called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and learn the prompts that can be used for this technique. You will also learn how to build a knowledge base for Amazon Bedrock, and explore the techniques to improve retrieval accuracy for this knowledge base. Finally, you will learn about the prompts for evaluating RAG using the "LLM-as-a-judge" method.
