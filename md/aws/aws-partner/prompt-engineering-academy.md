| Prompt Engineering Academy Session 3 | This content provides model-agnostic guidelines on prompt engineering for generative AI workloads. In this session discover guidelines to secure generative AI workloads, including securing prompts from vulnerabilities using Guardrails for Amazon Bedrock. | <ul><li>[Video](https://partnercentral.awspartner.com/partnercentral2/s/resources?Id=a1G8W00000F9j5fUAB)</li><li>[Slides](https://partnercentral.awspartner.com/partnercentral2/s/resources?Id=0698W0000105pw9QAA)</li><li>[<img src='https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/124/124036.png' width='16'>](https://vimeo.com/1013688350)</li></ul> |
| Prompt Engineering Academy Session 4 | In this session, you will learn about a popular generative AI technique called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and learn the prompts that can be used for this technique. You will also learn how to build a knowledge base for Amazon Bedrock, and explore the techniques to improve retrieval accuracy for this knowledge base. Finally, you will learn about the prompts for evaluating RAG using the "LLM-as-a-judge" method. | <ul><li>[Video](https://partnercentral.awspartner.com/partnercentral2/s/resources?Id=a1G8W00000F9jAeUAJ)</li><li>[Slides](https://partnercentral.awspartner.com/partnercentral2/s/resources?Id=0698W00001062qdQAA)</li><li>[<img src='https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/124/124036.png' width='16'>](https://vimeo.com/1017306514)</li></ul> |
