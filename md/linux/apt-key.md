This error message: "W: [http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/jammy-security/InRelease](http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/jammy-security/InRelease): The key(s) in the keyring /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ubuntu-keyring-2012-cdimage.gpg are ignored as the file is not readable by user '\_apt' executing apt-key." indicates a permissions issue with a GPG key file used by `apt`. The `_apt` user, which `apt` runs as, doesn't have the necessary read permissions for that file.

Here's how to resolve it:

**The Recommended (Modern) Way: Handling apt-key Deprecation**

This error often appears alongside warnings about `apt-key` being deprecated. Ubuntu (especially 22.04 "Jammy" and newer) is moving away from storing keys in `/etc/apt/trusted.gpg` or `/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/` because keys in these locations are globally trusted for *all* repositories. The new, more secure method is to store keys in `/etc/apt/keyrings/` and reference them explicitly in your `sources.list` entries using `signed-by`.

While you might just fix the permissions, it's a good opportunity to adopt the recommended approach. Here's the general process:

1.  **Identify the problematic key:**
    The error message explicitly points to `/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ubuntu-keyring-2012-cdimage.gpg`. This is an official Ubuntu key.

2.  **Ensure correct permissions for the keyrings directory:**
    The `_apt` user needs to be able to read files in `/etc/apt/keyrings/`.

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -m 0755 -p /etc/apt/keyrings/
    sudo chmod 0755 /etc/apt/keyrings/
    ```

3.  **Correct the permissions for the specific key file (if you want to stick with the old method temporarily):**
    If you just want to get rid of the warning without fully migrating to the new key management system (though it's highly recommended to migrate), you can set the permissions of the file so `_apt` can read it.

    ```bash
    sudo chmod 644 /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ubuntu-keyring-2012-cdimage.gpg
    ```

    This makes the file readable by all users, which is generally acceptable for public keys.

4.  **Update your `apt` sources:**
    After making changes, always run:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```

    This will re-evaluate your package sources and hopefully, the warning will be gone.

**Why the error occurs (permissions):**

The user `_apt` is a special system user that `apt` uses for its operations. If a GPG key file (which `apt` needs to verify the authenticity of packages) isn't readable by this user, then `apt` will ignore it, leading to the warning you see. This often happens due to incorrect file permissions or ownership.

**Important Note on `apt-key` and deprecation:**

Even if you fix the permissions, you might still see warnings like "Warning: apt-key is deprecated." This is a separate issue related to the long-term plan for `apt`'s key management. For official Ubuntu repositories, these keys are usually handled automatically. For third-party repositories, you'll eventually need to move towards the `signed-by` method in your `sources.list` files.

If you have other `apt-key` warnings for third-party repositories, you'll need to:

1.  Find the public key for that repository (usually from the repository's official documentation).
2.  Download it and place it in `/etc/apt/keyrings/` (using `curl` and `gpg --dearmor`).
3.  Modify the corresponding `sources.list.d/*.list` file to include `signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/your-key.gpg`.
4.  Remove the old key from `/etc/apt/trusted.gpg` or `/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/` using `sudo apt-key del <KEY_ID>`.

For the specific `ubuntu-keyring-2012-cdimage.gpg` file, simply correcting the permissions should be sufficient to resolve the warning, as it's an official Ubuntu key.
