<!-- add Chatbot Response bellow-->
Microsoft Teams **does not natively allow saving Live Captions** as a file during a meeting. However, there are a few workarounds depending on your needs:

---

### ‚úÖ **Option 1: Use Live Transcription (Built-in)**
If you're the **organizer or have permission**, you can enable **Live Transcription**, which:
- Captures spoken content in real-time.
- Saves the transcript automatically after the meeting.
- Stores it in the meeting chat or in OneDrive/SharePoint (if the meeting is recorded).

### üß© **Option 2: Use a Chrome Extension**
A developer created a Chrome extension called **MS Teams Live Captions Saver** that:
- Scrapes live captions from the Teams web interface.
- Saves them to a file in real-time.

üîß To use it:
1. Install the extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://spdenis.com/exporting-live-captions-from-microsoft-teams/).
2. Join your Teams meeting via teams.microsoft.com in Chrome or Edge.
3. The extension will capture and save captions automatically.

### üìù **Option 3: Manual Copy-Paste**
If you're using Live Captions (not Transcription), you can:
- Manually copy the captions during the meeting.
- Paste them into a Word or Notepad file.

This is tedious and not ideal for long meetings.
