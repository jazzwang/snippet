While they might look similar at a glance (sticky notes moving across columns), the logic behind how they function is quite different. The fundamental split is between **continuous flow** and **fixed intervals**.

### At a Glance: Key Differences

| Feature | Scrum Board | Kanban Board |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Cadence** | Regular intervals called **Sprints** (usually 1–4 weeks). | **Continuous** flow; no set start or end dates. |
| **Board Reset** | The board is cleared/reset after every sprint. | The board is persistent and never "reset." |
| **WIP Limits** | Indirect (limited by the team's capacity for the sprint). | Direct (limits are set on specific columns, e.g., "Max 3 tasks in Testing"). |
| **Task Ownership** | Usually owned by the team; everyone commits to the sprint goal. | Tasks are often "pulled" by individuals as capacity opens up. |
| **Change Policy** | Discouraged once a sprint starts to prevent "scope creep." | Changes can be made at any time; new tasks are added to the backlog. |

### 1. The Concept of Time

* **Scrum:** Think of it like a **relay race**. You have a set distance (the Sprint) to cover. Once the race is over, you evaluate, take a breath, and start a brand-new race with a fresh board.
* **Kanban:** Think of it like a **factory assembly line**. The work never stops. As soon as one item moves out of "Done," a new item is pulled into "To Do." It’s a permanent, evolving stream.

### 2. Work-in-Progress (WIP) Limits

* **Scrum:** You limit work by **volume**. You decide, "We can only do 10 things this week." If you finish early, you might pull more, but the limit is the Sprint's total capacity.
* **Kanban:** You limit work by **bottlenecks**. You might say, "Our developers are fast, but our QA person is slow, so we can only have 2 items in the 'Testing' column at once." This forces the team to help clear the bottleneck before starting new work.

### 3. Flexibility

* **Scrum** is more disciplined. If your boss asks for a new feature on Tuesday but the Sprint started Monday, they usually have to wait until the next Sprint.
* **Kanban** is more reactive. If a high-priority "fire" comes in, you can drop it into the "To Do" column immediately, and it will be the next thing the team picks up.

> **The Verdict:** Use **Scrum** if you are building a product and need a structured roadmap. Use **Kanban** if you are in a high-demand environment with changing priorities, like IT support or content creation.

Would you like me to help you design a custom board layout for a specific project you're working on?
