> A Challenging, Contamination-Free LLM Benchmark

- LiveBench appeared as a Spotlight Paper in ICLR 2025.
- LiveBench: a benchmark for LLMs designed with test set contamination and objective evaluation in mind. It has the following properties:
  - LiveBench limits potential contamination by releasing new questions regularly.
  - Each question has verifiable, objective ground-truth answers, eliminating the need for an LLM judge.
  - LiveBench currently contains a set of 23 diverse tasks across 7 categories, and we will release new, harder tasks over time.
