In the context of "Conducting EDA on text data as well as small scale LLM based experiments," EDA stands for **Exploratory Data Analysis**.

Here's what that means in this context:

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on text data:** This involves analyzing and summarizing the main characteristics of your text dataset. For text data, EDA typically includes:
    * **Basic statistics:** Word counts, character counts, sentence counts, average sentence/word length.
    * **Frequency analysis:** Identifying the most frequent words, n-grams (sequences of words), or unique terms.
    * **Text preprocessing insights:** Understanding common patterns, identifying noise (e.g., special characters, HTML tags), and determining appropriate cleaning steps (e.g., stop word removal, stemming/lemmatization).
    * **Distribution analysis:** Looking at the distribution of text lengths, vocabulary size, etc.
    * **Visualization:** Creating word clouds (though sometimes criticized for limited insight), bar charts of word frequencies, or plots of text length distributions.
    * **Identifying themes/topics:** Early attempts at understanding the main subjects or categories within the text (though full topic modeling might come later).
    * **Missing data/duplicates:** Checking for and understanding issues related to data quality.

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in LLM-based experiments:** While the core meaning of EDA remains the same (understanding your data), in the context of LLMs, it can also extend to:
    * **Analyzing the input/output data of LLMs:** This might involve examining the prompts used, the responses generated by the LLM, and comparing them to expected outputs or ground truth.
    * **Understanding LLM behavior:** Observing patterns in how the LLM generates text, identifying potential biases, or noting common types of errors or "hallucinations."
    * **Dataset characteristics for LLMs:** If you're using text data to fine-tune or evaluate an LLM, EDA helps you understand if your data is suitable, diverse enough, and free of issues that could negatively impact the LLM's performance. This could include checking for data duplication, class imbalance in labeled data, or the presence of specific keywords/phrases.

In essence, EDA is a crucial preliminary step to gain insights, identify patterns, spot anomalies, and understand the characteristics of your data *before* diving into more complex modeling or experimentation, whether it's with raw text or with the inputs and outputs of LLMs.

* `Lemmatization` is a process in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that reduces words to their base or dictionary form, known as a lemma. It aims to identify the root form of a word by considering its context and meaning, ensuring that the output is a valid and meaningful word. Unlike stemming, which may produce non-meaningful stems, lemmatization relies on dictionaries and morphological analysis to determine the correct lemma.
