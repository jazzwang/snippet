Using AI chatbots can result in sensitive information falling into the wrong hands and put the security of sensitive information at risk.

The information you provide to an AI chatbot will be retained and used for future responses. Do not provide an AI chatbot with sensitive information, such as 

- proprietary business information (information created by the organization), 
- material nonpublic information (MNPI) (organizational information not released to the public), or 
- personal information (information that can identify an individual). 

If you were to provide it, that sensitive information would become part of the AI chatbot’s pool of data. This data would then be used for future query responses, which could give people outside our organization access to the organizational or personal information you provided.

Make sure to be aware of our organizational policy related to the disclosure of information and only use approved AI applications at work.

Remember: Never provide an AI chatbot with sensitive information, and always check our organization’s policy and get approval before using AI chatbots for work purposes.

In the past year, 35% of organizations claim they are already using AI, and another 42% say they are exploring the option. AI may be the future, but don’t let it scare you. By knowing how to use AI chatbots effectively and following best practices, you can ensure that your data and our organization’s data stay safe and the information you receive is accurate.
