Yes, Outlook does offer options to automatically accept meeting invitations, though the availability and behavior can vary slightly depending on whether you're using:

- **Outlook Desktop App (Windows/Mac)**
- **Outlook Web (Outlook on the web / Outlook.com)**
- **Microsoft Exchange / Office 365 backend**

### Here's how to enable auto-accept for meeting invitations:

#### **For Outlook Desktop (Windows)**
1. Go to **File** > **Options** > **Calendar**.
2. Scroll to the **Automatic accept or decline** section.
3. Click **Auto Accept/Decline...**
4. Check:
   - **Automatically accept meeting requests and remove canceled meetings**
   - Optionally, also check **Automatically decline conflicting meeting requests**

#### **For Outlook Web (OWA)**
1. Click the **Settings gear icon** > **View all Outlook settings**.
2. Go to **Calendar** > **Events and invitations**.
3. Enable:
   - **Automatically add events to my calendar from email**
   - **Delete canceled events**
   - **Mark events as private**

Note: This doesn't fully auto-accept meetings, but it helps with auto-adding and managing them.

#### **Using PowerShell (for Exchange Admins)**
If you're managing a resource mailbox (like a meeting room), you can use PowerShell to configure auto-accept:

```powershell
Set-CalendarProcessing -Identity "RoomName" -AutomateProcessing AutoAccept
```

how to disable auto-accept for meeting invitations?
</td></tr><tr><td>A:</td><td>

To **disable auto-accept for meeting invitations** in Outlook, you’ll need to adjust your calendar settings depending on the version you're using. Here's how to do it:

---

### **Outlook Desktop (Windows)**
1. Go to **File** > **Options** > **Calendar**.
2. Scroll down to **Automatic accept or decline**.
3. Click **Auto Accept/Decline...**
4. **Uncheck**:
   - **Automatically accept meeting requests and remove canceled meetings**
   - **Automatically decline conflicting meeting requests**
5. Click **OK** to save.

---

### **Outlook Web (OWA / Outlook.com)**
Outlook Web doesn’t have a direct “auto-accept” toggle like the desktop version, but it may auto-add events from email.

To disable that:
1. Click the **Settings gear icon** > **View all Outlook settings**.
2. Go to **Calendar** > **Events and invitations**.
3. **Uncheck**:
   - **Automatically add events to my calendar from email**

---

### **For Resource Mailboxes (Exchange Admins)**
If you're managing a shared mailbox or room resource:

```powershell
Set-CalendarProcessing -Identity "RoomName" -AutomateProcessing AutoUpdate
```

This disables full auto-accept and switches to manual processing.
