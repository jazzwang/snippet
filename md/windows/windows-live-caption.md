</td></tr><tr><td>A:</td><td>

Currently, **Windows Live Captions does not natively support saving or exporting transcripts** to a file. The captions are generated in real-time and are not stored on disk or in any accessible log file by default [1](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/is-it-possible-to-save-a-transcript-of-live/3474cc04-1d34-4e51-bf99-aa7dc0e0fdd0).

However, there is a **third-party solution** available:

### ðŸ›  GitHub Project: `get-livecaptions`
A community-developed tool written in Rust, [**get-livecaptions**](https://github.com/msftwarelab/get-livecaptions), can:
- Capture Windows 11 Live Captions in real-time.
- Save them to a specified text file at regular intervals.
- Provide a user interface for viewing and copying captions.
- Optionally integrate with OpenAI for querying the captured text.

#### Requirements:
- Windows 11 with Live Captions enabled.
- Rust installed on your system.
- Basic command-line usage.

#### Example usage:
```bash
cargo run -- --file output.txt --interval 1
```
This command captures captions every second and writes them to `output.txt`.
