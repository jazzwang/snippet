Monthly CTC (Cost to Company) represents the total annual cost an employer incurs for an employee, divided by 12 to get a monthly figure. It includes not just the employee's salary, but also benefits like employer contributions to provident fund, health insurance, and other allowances. Essentially, it's the total expense the company bears to have you on their payroll, encompassing both direct and indirect costs. 

Here's a breakdown:

-   **CTC (Cost to Company):**
    This is the total annual compensation package an employer provides, including salary, benefits, and other perks. 

-   **Monthly CTC:**
    This is the CTC divided by 12, representing the average monthly cost to the company for employing an individual. 

-   **In-Hand Salary:**
    This is the amount an employee actually receives after deductions (like taxes and provident fund contributions). 

Example:

If an employee's annual CTC is NT$600,000, the monthly CTC would be NT$50,000 (600,000 / 12). However, the in-hand salary would be lower due to deductions.
